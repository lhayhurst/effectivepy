### Deployed Stack

This repo isn't meant to be deployed, as it is just my [hypermodern Python](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/#setting-up-a-python-project-using-poetry) exploration on the [Effective Python](https://effectivepython.com/) book. All interaction with the code is of the `make test` variety.
